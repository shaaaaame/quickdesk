Show how you would improve the design of your classes, apply various design
patterns and techniques as you see fit.

There are several ways to improve this design:
- Building the classes on top of a different data structure on a 
  needs basis, for example using doubly linked lists instead of arrays
  since they include pointers at bottom and top.
- Additionally, using a doubly linked lists allows implementation of 
  a circular queue, to maximise space usage. 
- Creating an abstract class on top of these classes so that 
  other implementations are more easily implemented (through templating)
